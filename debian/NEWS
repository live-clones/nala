nala (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium
  The configuration file for Nala at `/etc/nala/nala.conf`
  has been changed to toml. This change is BREAKING as the older config
  file will no longer work. Nala will still run with the old config,
  but there will be a syntax error and it will use the program defaults.
