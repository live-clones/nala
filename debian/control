Description: commandline wrapper for the apt package manager
 nala is a wrapper for the apt package manager. It has a lot
 of the same functionality, but formats the output to be more
 human readable. Also implements a history function to see past
 transactions and undo/redo them. Much like Fedora's dnf history.
